## Installation

Most of the installation stuff is useless as several values are hard coded. I'd suggest just taking the code and creating your own deploy procedures.

Run `./deploy.ps1` to deploy the files to the server. (hard coded server name/paths)
After that log on and either run install or just restart the service (depending on what changed).
